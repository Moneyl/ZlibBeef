# Zlib beef wrap
Zlib wrapper for BeefLang. This isn't intended for general use. I just made it for [RfgTools](https://github.com/Moneyl/RfgTools) so I only wrapped the functions I needed for that. 

I also made choices that aren't ideal for general use like using zlib version 1.2.3 for compatibility reasons. That version is over 10 years old.
